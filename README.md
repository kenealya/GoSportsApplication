Project created for "RateMyAgent" as part of a technical test.
All source code located in this repository is to be treated only as a Proof-of-Concept for technical analysis of abilities.

Assumptions made:
Due to time-limit the app is not a fully functional prototype or Proof-of-Concept
Due to users not being technically experienced, the application inputs must be simple
the service used is intended to be a light-weight process

Hours Spent:
1.5 hours - StoryBoarding
1 hour - Project setup
2.5 hours - Front-End development
1 hour - Back-End development
